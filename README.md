Third game: Pig
Pig is a two-player game where the players take turns repeatedly rolling a single 6-sided dice. A player repeatedly rolls the die until one of two events occurs. Either the player chooses to stop rolling, in which case the sum of that playerâ€™s roll are added to their total points; or if the player rolls a 1, all points for that turn are lost and their turn ends immediately. The first player to reach a score of at least 100 points wins.
